### My Fork Goals

The CMS is need a new version,  it has been  proven  that the  concept is solid
but it's hard to implement to an exist system.  So keeping that in mind we want
to switch to  Laravel  framework which is  the most  used framework nowdays.  

Content Management System should not require a theming option or even a
template engine to render, nowdays the frontend evolving without the backend.
A backend should provide API for it's functionalities so it could be integrated
into any frontend application or backend application.
